Description: Hypothesis-testing on bi-allelic genomic data using Bayesian 
    hybrid index and genomic cline parameter estimation, including data input 
	and preparation functions, and some useful plots. It takes a structure 
	file or a similar data table as input, identifies the allele with 
	relatively higher frequency in each parental reference sample, calculates 
	quantities such as allele frequency for parental reference samples, allows 
	filtering based on these quantities, and creates a genotype table ordered 
	by allele parent-of-origin if desired. Hybrid index and genomic cline 
	parameters can be pooled or fixed and model comparison carried out using 
	the Bayesian widely applicable information criterion (waic).
